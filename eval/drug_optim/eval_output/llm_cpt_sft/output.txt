This modification preserves the molecular scaffold structure but eliminates the halogen, following the rule that halogens increase DILI risk. The resulting molecule is still Lipinski compliant and follows the other constraints.

This molecule has the following properties: Lipinski compliant; reduced AMES risk.	FC1=CC=C(C=N1)C1=CN=C(C2=CNC3=NC=CN=C23)N1	The original molecule has a high AMES risk due to the presence of a 2-fluoro-1,3-dihydroindole, which may act as a heme ligand. To reduce AMES risk, the fluoro group is removed. The methoxy group remains to maintain lipophilicity while ensuring Lipinski compliance (logP < 3). The modified 2,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrole moiety facilitates the removal of the fluoro substituent and reduces heme binding potential, thus lowering the AMES risk. The molecule remains structurally similar, with a single tautomer at physiological pH.
